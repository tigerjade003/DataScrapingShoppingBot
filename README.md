# DataScrapingShoppingBot
A Bot that will periodically check websites, and hold items in carts for you. It will also notify you when your price reaches a certain price point.

In order to set it up, you will need to create a .env file.
Then create an application in discord, and get the key ID. 
set that as your Application token, and then add your user id in another part.

# TODO List
1) get a server to host the bot instead of running it on my computer
2) get a template set up for the .env file in order to allow for easy usability
3) Set up a way to directly have the thing added to the cart and get the cookie of the cart for immediate checkout
4) Expand usability past Best Buy Sites - and make it so it doesn't look for one specific thing, instead looking for objects.
